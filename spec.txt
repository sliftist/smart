NEED: ferrite cores

0) RUN ON RASPBERRY PI!
    - Otherwise this doesn't work overnight!
    - Need to run both humidifier and thermostat
    - SHOULD just work, but we'll see...
    - Ugh... do ssh disk syncing, so we can still view metrics locally

1) Floor plan with visualized metrics (not over time, but we can seek times to see them change)
