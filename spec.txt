NEED: ferrite cores

TODO: Autorefresh breaks when we restart the pi?
    - I think if it goes down it breaks the file system api handles?
    - Maybe it should just refresh the page, instead of reloading the data?

- Parameterize humid, to accept humidity (single value), plug mac address and humidity detector id
- Run two, in different rooms?

Better chart display of points
    - Add back point display, just make them smaller?

Have chart show all values in a line, instead of just the closest x value.

- Properly bundle the required RTL libraries for Linux. Apparently their release is missing some of the shared libraries.
    - sudo apt install librtlsdr0

1) Floor plan with visualized metrics (not over time, but we can seek times to see them change)
